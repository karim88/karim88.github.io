      The sugar industry, one of the best structured in Moroccan agriculture, aims to further improve its indicators through digitization.
      Developed by the Cosumar group, the Attaissir system allows, thanks to smart cards given to 80,000 farmers, to provide integrated support for:
      -the technical and agronomic supervision of farmers for better monitoring.
      -the tracking by geolocation of plots of sugar plants.
      -production planning and monitoring, from sowing to harvesting to transport to factories.
      -the continuous management of agricultural input distribution centers, as well as service providers working upstream of the sugar ecosystem.
      Each farmer is provided with a personalized (and free) smart card ensuring traceability throughout the sugar value chain.
      It brings more comfort to the daily life of Cosumar&apos;s agricultural partners and allows them to follow,
      in real time and in complete transparency, the operations linked to their activity.
      &qout;The contract between the farmer and Cosumar includes a set of information such as the area of ​​the plot, as well as the nature of the necessary inputs.
      This data is stored on the smart card, the farmer having only to present it to his agricultural advisor to recover the inputs he needs,
      in appropriate quantities &qout;, explains the management of Cosumar.
      Before the deployment of the Attaissir device, when everything was done manually, the farmer had to go physically to his agricultural advisor,
      who collects information in order to calculate the farmer&apos;s input needs. A time-consuming process.

      Now the farmer goes to the nearest Agricultural Distribution Center (CDA) with his smart card. Reading the data makes it possible to directly supply the farmer with adequate inputs and in the quantities required. This saves time for the farmer, but also for the agricultural advisor. The latter, relieved of all time-consuming paperwork, can now concentrate on the heart of his profession, which is technical support and agricultural advice in the broad sense.

      &qout;We are giving the farmer the opportunity to benefit from personalized and specialized agricultural support&qout;, we are pleased to say within Cosumar.

      Digital management at local and regional levels

      All of Cosumar&apos;s sugar factories (sugar extraction units) have been equipped with control centers, which make it possible to follow the development of the agricultural campaign in real time. The data is consolidated in order to also carry out local and regional management.

      Attaissir also extends to agricultural machines, which are equipped with sensors intended to determine the opportune moment of harvests according to their maturity, the layout of the machines which must be very straight, their speed which differs according to the sowing and harvest, ... Precision work because any deviation can have negative consequences on the productivity of farmers.

      When an anomaly is automatically detected, an alert is triggered at the control center, in order to adjust the parameters and react in real time. Each field is associated with an agricultural advisor, who is usually the first person contacted to rectify the situation.

      A fleet of 1,500 agricultural machines in total is thus equipped with sensors: transport trucks, tractors, sowing machines, etc. These play a particular role in the sugar value chain: “every truck is equipped with a GPS and a magnetic card reader. When the farmer loads his crop, the transporter scans the smart card. This makes it possible to geolocate the origin of the load and, following the weighing, to automatically determine the remuneration of each farmer &qout;, specifies the management of Cosumar.

      We will have to wait until the end of the current sugar campaign to measure the real impact. But according to Cosumar, we are already beginning to see the positive impact of Attaissir on agricultural yields.

      About ten companies have participated in the development of the Attaissir project. Among them, a Moroccan start-up founded by young people &qout;without much experience but with great potential&qout;, in the words of the management of Cosumar. Specializing in geolocation, the Moroccan start-up has thus been a great contribution to the realization of the Attaissir project, even though this is its first contract with a large company.
